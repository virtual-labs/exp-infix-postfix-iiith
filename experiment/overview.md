### Prerequisites of the Experiment

   - Basic knowledge on [Infix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix), and [Postfix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postfix)
   - [Basic mathematical expressions and their functionings](https://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-a-mathematical-expression-definition-examples-quiz.html)
   - [Operation of stack by Push and Pop methods](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/stack_algorithm.htm)
   - [A little bit about Expression trees(not necessary)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree)
   - And above all, a curiosity to learn and explore!

### Overview of the Experiment

   - The aim of this experiment is to understand the push and pop operations of stack and conversion of infix expressions to postfix expressions using stack and without using stack.
   - The experiment features a series of modules with video lectures, interactive demonstrations, simulations, hands-on practice exercises and quizzes for self analysis.
